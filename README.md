## Summary

This project instilled a profound respect for the craft of programming. In making this calculator I learned to appreciate all of the intricate processes that go on in our computers that we aren't aware of. I have learned so much in the ways of writing logic and abstracting concerns. I first had all of the JavaScript code written in one file, but I was getting overwhelmed with managing my code, so I decided to put into practice something that I had some small experience with: Modules. 

Once modules were introduced it became much easier to manage my code and understnad what I wanted to, was trying to do, and what I can do. 

Outside of that, this gave me much more experience in DOM manipulation and data storage.
